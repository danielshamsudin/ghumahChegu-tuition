# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a tuition management system built with Next.js 15 and Firebase. The application manages three user roles: superadmin, teacher, and student. It provides functionality for student registration with custom hourly rates, class/subject scheduling with multi-day recurrence, attendance tracking grouped by subjects, and automated PDF invoice generation with detailed breakdowns.

## Common Commands

- **Development server**: `npm run dev` (but note: CLAUDE COMMAND says do not run npm run dev)
- **Build**: `npm run build`
- **Production start**: `npm start`
- **Lint**: `npm run lint`

## Architecture

### Core Structure
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Firebase Authentication and Firestore
- **State Management**: React Context API for auth state

### Key Directories
- `src/app/`: App Router pages (dashboard, login, superadmin, teacher)
- `src/components/ui/`: Reusable UI components from shadcn/ui
- `src/context/`: React context providers (AuthContext)
- `src/lib/`: Firebase configuration and utilities

### Authentication & Authorization
- Firebase Auth with role-based access control
- User roles stored in Firestore `/users/{uid}` collection
- AuthContext provides `currentUser`, `userRole`, and `loading` state
- Role-based routing:
  - `/` redirects to `/login` if not authenticated, `/dashboard` if authenticated
  - Teachers → `/dashboard` (TeacherHomepage component)
  - Superadmin → `/superadmin` or `/dashboard`
  - Legacy teacher panel at `/teacher` (kept for backward compatibility)

### Database Schema
Firestore collections:
- `users`: User profiles with role field (superadmin/teacher/student)
- `students`: Student records with fields:
  - `name` (required), `email` (optional), `hourlyRate` (required, custom per student)
  - `teacherId` (links to teacher), `createdAt`
- `subjects`: Class/subject schedules with fields:
  - `name`, `startTime`, `endTime`, `teacherId`
  - `recurring`: 'weekly' or 'none'
  - `daysOfWeek`: Array of day numbers [0-6] for weekly recurring (supports multiple days)
  - `date`: Specific date string for one-time classes
  - Backward compatible with old `dayOfWeek` single-day format
- `subjectAssignments`: Links students to subjects
  - `studentId`, `subjectId`, `teacherId`, `createdAt`
- `attendance`: Attendance records with fields:
  - `studentId`, `subjectId`, `teacherId`, `date`, `status` ('present'/'absent')
  - Tracks attendance per student per subject per date
- `invoices`: Generated invoice records with fields:
  - `studentId`, `teacherId`, `month`, `year`, `amount`, `status`
  - `details`: Object containing breakdown by subject and grand total

### Firebase Security Rules
Complex role-based rules in `firestore.rules`:
- Teachers can only access their own students' data
- Students can only access their own records
- Superadmins have full access
- Known issue: Use `resource.data.fieldId` not `request.query.get('fieldId')` for document field validation

### UI Framework
- shadcn/ui components configured in `components.json`
- Tailwind CSS with custom configuration
- Lucide React for icons
- Components use JSX (not TSX) as per configuration

### Main Components
- `src/app/page.js`: Root route with authentication-based redirect
- `src/app/dashboard/page.js`: Main dashboard, renders TeacherHomepage for teachers
- `src/components/TeacherHomepage.jsx`: Primary teacher interface with tabs:
  - Overview: Calendar and today's classes
  - Students: Manage students with hourly rates
  - Attendance: Mark attendance grouped by subjects
  - Invoices: Generate PDF receipts
  - Classes: Manage subjects and student assignments

## Dependencies

### Core
- Next.js 15 with App Router and Turbopack
- React 19
- Firebase (auth, firestore)
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui components

### PDF Generation
- `jspdf`: PDF creation library
- `jspdf-autotable`: Table plugin for jsPDF

### Icons
- `lucide-react`: Icon library

## Development Notes

- The codebase uses JavaScript (.js/.jsx) rather than TypeScript
- Firebase config contains live API keys (consider environment variables for production)
- Currency is RM (Malaysian Ringgit)
- Hourly rates are custom per student (default RM35 when creating new students)
- When importing jsPDF, use: `import { jsPDF } from 'jspdf'` and `import autoTable from 'jspdf-autotable'`

## Key Features

### Student Management
- Add/edit/delete students with custom hourly rates
- Email field is optional (only name and hourly rate required)
- Students displayed with their individual rates

### Subject/Class Management
- Create subjects with name and time slots
- Support for weekly recurring (multiple days per week) or one-time classes
- Example: A subject can recur on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
- Edit subjects to change name, times, and recurring days
- Assign students to subjects with searchable checkbox interface
- Calendar view shows days with scheduled classes

### Attendance Tracking
- Attendance tab shows only classes scheduled for selected date
- Students grouped by their subjects/classes
- Each subject displays its time and enrolled students
- Attendance tracked per student per subject per date
- Supports students attending multiple classes on same day

### Invoice Generation
- Generates PDF receipts with filename format: `{StudentName}_{MonthYear}.pdf`
- PDF contains detailed breakdown:
  - Table showing each subject attended
  - Number of sessions per subject
  - Rate per session (student's hourly rate)
  - Subtotal per subject
  - Grand total for the month
- Uses jsPDF and jspdf-autotable libraries
- Professional formatted receipts with blue headers and striped rows
- Automatically saves invoice record to Firestore

## Important Implementation Details

### Multi-Day Recurring Classes
- Subjects store `daysOfWeek` as an array of integers [0-6] where 0=Sunday, 6=Saturday
- Old single-day format (`dayOfWeek` as single integer) is backward compatible
- Filtering logic checks both new array format and old single-day format
- UI uses checkboxes for selecting multiple days when creating/editing subjects

### Attendance System
- Composite key used: `${studentId}_${subjectId}` for tracking attendance records
- Allows same student to have different attendance status for different classes on same day
- fetchAttendance() creates unique keys combining student and subject IDs
- handleMarkAttendance() saves with subjectId field in Firestore

### Student Search in Assignment
- Real-time filtering as user types in search field
- Checkbox interface for multi-select (no need for Ctrl/Cmd)
- Shows count of selected students
- Prevents duplicate assignments (checks existing before adding)

### PDF Generation Flow
1. Query attendance records filtered by student, teacher, month, and 'present' status
2. Group attendance records by subjectId
3. Calculate sessions per subject and subtotal (sessions × hourly rate)
4. Generate PDF using jsPDF with autoTable for formatted table
5. Save PDF with descriptive filename
6. Store invoice record in Firestore with breakdown details
